# Book-Search-Engine-MERN
A search engine using Google Books API. This app was built using the MERN stack.

## Description

Originally, this Google Books API search engine was built with a RESTful API, and was refactored to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It was already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.


## What was the motivation?

To understand the benefits of using GraphQL API over RESTful API, which involves more precise requests and simplier handling of CRUD operations with one endpoint.


## What problems does it solve and what did you learn?

GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching issues commonly encountered with REST APIs. Also, GraphQL has a single endpoint which can handle both queries and mutations. This refactoring project has taught me the efficiency and flexibility of GraphQL, and the simplicity of handling one endpoint.
